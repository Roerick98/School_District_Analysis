# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the project
### Purpose
- The purpose of this project was to conduct data analysis upon test scores from the different schools within the district and determine whether or not dishonest test scores from the Thomas High School 9th grade class affected the overall analysis. 
## Results
### How is the district summary affected?
- Comparing the data from PyCitySchools.ipynb and PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb, there is no change.
### How is the school summary affected?
- Before the change was implemented, the overall passing percentage for the students of Thomas High School was approximately 90.94%. After the grades for the 9th graders were taken out, the overall passing percentage decreases by about 0.3%.
